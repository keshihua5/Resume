### Senior Technical Writer

------

 I ‒ love technology, research, writing, and words. I'm a "technicalwriter/editor" with extensive domestic/international experience. 

Moved to Seattle from Beijing, China (where I've lived/worked for 14.5 years). Worked 12.5 years as a [Senior Technical Writer](https://github.com/keshihua5/resume/blob/master/images/rc_lor.pdf), and two years as a [College/University English instructor](https://youtu.be/H2Brkd42aIc). I speak fluentMandarin Chinese. 

 The skills and qualifications that make me a great senior technicalwriter candidate for your company include:

• documentation creation/management
• communication
• collaboration
• problem-solving .

My professional background allows me to research, write, edit, proofread, assimilate, catalog, and design both **technical** and **non-technical** documentation. I consider myself a “technical writing universal soldier”, due to my ability to multitask.
